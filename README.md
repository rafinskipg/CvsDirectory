### DONE List:
 - Add templating ( underscore maybe)

### IDEAS List:
 - An user can create more than one CV depending on his needs. (Maybe he can load one of the existing CV and modify it)
 - Add combos for professions and what we think it's important so we can translate them into other languages
 - Add more templates like "Others" and "Languages" (Also add photos and videos for designers)
 - Export CV to PDF and other formats (JasperReports maybe)
 - Add Reveal JS for creating Slide - Presentations http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/
