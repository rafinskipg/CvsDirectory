This is a HTML 5 app for hosting my friends CVs.
---

TODO List:
 - Change styles
 - Clear old data
 
DONE List:
 - Add templating ( underscore maybe)

IDEAS List:
 - An user can create more than one CV depending on his needs. (Maybe he can load one of the existing CV and modify it)
 - Add combos for professions and what we think it's important so we can translate them into other languages
 - Add more templates like "Others" and "Languages" (Also add photos and videos for designers)
 - Export CV to PDF and other formats (JasperReports maybe)
